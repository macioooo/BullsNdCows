This is a simple game of code-breaking. The computer generates a secret code, and the player has to guess it. At each turn, the player guesses a number, and the computer tells them how many bulls and cows they have. A bull is a symbol (digit or a letter, depends how many signs in game you will choose) that is both in the secret code and in the correct position. A cow is a symbol that is in the secret code, but not in the correct position.

The game is over when the player guesses the secret code correctly.
